        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description">Onigiri, also known as omusubi, nigirimeshi, or rice ball, is a Japanese food made from white rice formed into triangular or cylindrical shapes and often wrapped in nori.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <div class="Ingredients">
            <ul class="ul1">
                <li>Rice</li>
                <li>Furikake</li>
                <li>Nori</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div class="Steps">
            <ol class="ol1">
                <li>Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl. Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly. Separate the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful each.</li>
                <li>Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. This stops the rice sticking to your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.</li>
                <li>Take up one portion of rice in your hands.</li>
                <li>If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.</li>
                <li>Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze the rice into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so it's even.</li>
                <li>Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri (the rough side should face the rice) and fold it up towards to the middle of the onigiri.</li>
                <li><strong>You just made an onigiri</strong><em> Itadakimasu!</em></li>
